### Hello and welcome to my Github, this is Hugo ðŸ‘‹
- I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Epi department at Dartmouth.
- I am studying the intersection between metabolic health and cancer risk. 
- I aim to investigate the contributions of genetics and exposome (environment) using causal inference methods.
- Iâ€™m currently working on GxE: a gene-environment interaction between genetic susceptibility and arsenic exposure using polygenic scores (PGS) associated with bladder cancer and xenobiotic metabolism.
